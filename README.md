## 1.3	Problem
The majority of people are facing skin problems that they cannot solve by themselves and need professional advice.  Most of the time, they are purchasing products recommended by social-media bloggers or celebrities. Regardless of the quality of those products, since every individual should use products that suit their conditions, those products do not provide the result that customers want. 
Some people also want to use specific products of their choice, namely cruelty-free, or with clean ingredients but they don’t know what product to use. Hours of research on finding the best product will be wasted, but most of the customers will not be able to find the best product for themselves.

 
The main problem is, although there are thousands of different skincare/ haircare or makeup products worldwide, people don’t know which one they should use, how to use it, and which ingredients help them to have healthier skin/hair. Moreover, most of them cannot find an expert who will guide and walk with them in this process. We are here to build that bridge and provide accessible service for every person who would like to have healthier skin, sustainable products, and create a better world for them.

By prioritising data security and privacy, we can establish a reputation for trustworthiness that leaves our users comfortable with putting out their data.

**3.6.3	Scalability to Accommodate Growing Users:**

Ensuring scalability requires careful infrastructure planning and selection. Cloud-based hosting solutions like Amazon Web Services (AWS) offer scalability options. When the website suddenly becomes very popular and gets lots of experts and customers, they can allocate more computing resources to handle the increased traffic. Implementing such auto-scaling features enables the system to automatically adjust resources, such as servers or storage, in response to increasing user load. The site will also be built in a way that it can handle increased traffic and user load without significant performance degradation. By ensuring scalability, the website can handle increasing demand, maintain smooth operations, and avoid potential downtime as the user base expands. 

**3.6.4	Fast and Responsive System Performance:**

Real-time interactions between customers and beauty experts require fast and responsive system performance. Backend development will focus on efficient coding practices and minimizing database queries or network requests. Caching mechanisms, such as browser caching, can be implemented to store frequently accessed data or static content, reducing the need for repeated requests. Also, employing content delivery networks (CDNs) will help to distribute content geographically, reducing latency and improving overall system performance. Regular performance testing and optimization efforts are important to identify and address any performance sluggishness.

**3.6.5	Integration with 3rd Party Platforms or APIs:**

APIs provided by social media platforms, payment gateways, and the like should be integrated into the system using appropriate API libraries. Authentication mechanisms, such as OAuth or API keys, can be implemented to communicate with these external services securely. The API documentation and guidelines that the platforms provide will be followed to ensure proper integration. For instance, integrating with popular social media platforms can facilitate easy user registration and sharing of beauty-related content. Incorporating product recommendation APIs can offer personalized suggestions based on customer preferences and improve the shopping experience. By integrating these external platforms or APIs, we can leverage their existing services, expand our functionality, and provide a more comprehensive solution to our users.

o	**Unit Testing:** Unit tests were used to validate the individual components of the application, such as controllers, services, and models. JUnit, a widely-used testing framework in Java, facilitated the creation and execution of unit tests.

o**Swagger UI:** Swagger UI was utilized as an additional testing method for the project. Swagger UI is an open-source tool that allows developers to interact with the API and visualize API documentation. It enables testers to explore and execute API endpoints directly from the user interface, making it a valuable asset for manual API testing.

The benefits of using Swagger UI for testing include:
- Interactive Testing: Swagger UI provided a user-friendly interface to interact with the API endpoints, making it easier for testers to understand the functionalities.
- Documentation: The API documentation generated by Swagger UI helped testers understand the request and response formats and the expected behavior of each endpoint.
- Speed and Efficiency: Swagger UI's intuitive interface allowed testers    to quickly execute API calls and validate responses, increasing the overall testing efficiency.
