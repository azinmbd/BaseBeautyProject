# 1. 1.	Project Overview
## 1.1	Introduction
The starting point of BASE BEAUTY project is to assist millions of people who seek an effective skincare/makeup/styling consultancy. 
Registered experts provide solutions for specific problems/concerns for customers. We have professionals who are expertized in different areas such as cruelty-free products, vegan products, acne-prone skin types, products with clean ingredients, allergies, and luxury products.

## 1.2	 Business Case 
BASE Beauty provides personalized consultancy mainly in two different areas. Skincare/haircare, and makeup. Our consultancy project provides,

**1.2.1	Personalized advice:**
It is important that customers are provided with customized skincare or makeup routines tailored to their specific needs and concerns.

 **1.2.2	Guidance from experts:**
Advice from professionals who can provide accurate and helpful information and advice on a broad range of topics

 **1.2.3	Providing convenience:**
Easy and accessible platform which allows them to connect with professionals without having to set up a physical meeting.

 **1.2.4	A trustworthy product recommendation:**
It is vital for customers to receive trustworthy product recommendations that are able to address their skincare and makeup concerns effectively.   

 **1.2.5	Problem-solving:** 
Many customers are looking for solutions to specific skin issues or makeup problems they are encountering in their everyday lives.  

In the business case, customers can choose their consultant according to their specific needs and concerns, schedule a virtual meeting, and get their service from wherever they are. After their meeting, they will be able to request follow-up sessions and see their history of consultation in their profile.


## 1.3	Problem
The majority of people are facing skin problems that they cannot solve by themselves and need professional advice.  Most of the time, they are purchasing products recommended by social-media bloggers or celebrities. Regardless of the quality of those products, since every individual should use products that suit their conditions, those products do not provide the result that customers want. 
Some people also want to use specific products of their choice, namely cruelty-free, or with clean ingredients but they don’t know what product to use. Hours of research on finding the best product will be wasted, but most of the customers will not be able to find the best product for themselves.

 
The main problem is, although there are thousands of different skincare/ haircare or makeup products worldwide, people don’t know which one they should use, how to use it, and which ingredients help them to have healthier skin/hair. Moreover, most of them cannot find an expert who will guide and walk with them in this process. We are here to build that bridge and provide accessible service for every person who would like to have healthier skin, sustainable products, and create a better world for them.
